# Creeper-Lv-s-Universal-dotNet-Library

Personal Use Libraries for my programs such as server, tools, games, etc.

# What's its goal?

To isolate some frequently used codes in my projects, and they can be updated independently. It can be useful on reducing file size.

# Design

## Two ways of use.

### 1. A common path to store libs.

I tend to use '~/.libs', '~/.libs/creeperlv', '~/.libraries/creeperlv', '~/.libraries/' for these paths are both available in Windows and Linux.

### 2. Include in application distribution.

To avoid user to think I am snooping his personal files.
